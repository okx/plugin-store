## Prerequisites

- No IP/region restrictions (public data API)
- `OKX_ROOTDATA_SKILL_KEY` environment variable (auto-provisioned via /init on first run)
- Internet access to api.rootdata.com
- Rate limit: 200 req/min per key

## Quick Start

1. **First-time setup**: ask the agent anything that uses RootData. If
   `OKX_ROOTDATA_SKILL_KEY` is missing, the skill calls `/init` to mint a key and
   stores it as an env var.
2. **Search**: e.g., "find Uniswap on RootData" → returns entity ID.
3. **Detail lookup**: pass the ID to project/funding endpoints for full data.
4. **Trending / job changes**: ask "what's hot today" or "who joined which crypto
   project this week".
