# RootData Crypto Intelligence (OKX Edition)

## Overview

RootData is a leading Web3 data platform covering crypto projects, investors, funding data, and personnel movements. This skill is the OKX-dedicated integration, isolated from the standard RootData skill with its own API key namespace and endpoints.

## Pre-flight Checks

Before using this skill, ensure:

1. Check if the environment variable `OKX_ROOTDATA_SKILL_KEY` exists.
2. If it does **NOT** exist, call the `/init` command below to generate a key and save it.
3. All subsequent requests must include `Authorization: Bearer {OKX_ROOTDATA_SKILL_KEY}` and `Content-Type: application/json`.

### Initialize API Key

`POST https://api.rootdata.com/open/okx/skill/init`

**When to use**: First-time setup, or when `OKX_ROOTDATA_SKILL_KEY` is missing or invalid.
**Output**: Returns `api_key` (prefixed with `okxsk_`). Save it as `OKX_ROOTDATA_SKILL_KEY`.
**Example**:

```
POST https://api.rootdata.com/open/okx/skill/init
Content-Type: application/json
Body: {}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "result": 200,
  "data": {
    "api_key": "okxsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```

After saving, confirm to user: "RootData (OKX) access is ready. You can now query crypto data."

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid `OKX_ROOTDATA_SKILL_KEY` | Re-run `/init` to generate a new key and update the env variable |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit exceeded (200 req/min) | Wait for the number of seconds in the `Retry-After` response header, then retry |
| `400 Bad Request` | Invalid or missing required parameters | Check request body; verify `type`, `days`, or `page` values are correct |
| `404 Not Found` | Entity ID does not exist | Confirm the ID via `/ser_inv` search before calling detail endpoints |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Upstream server error | Retry after a short delay; if persistent, report to RootData support |
| `result` field ≠ `200` | Application-level error | Read the `message` field in the response for details |

If you receive HTTP `429`, check the `Retry-After` header and wait before retrying. Monitor `X-RateLimit-Remaining` to track remaining quota.
